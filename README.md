This project was designed as a Project Week 1 assignment for UofT coding bootcamp. 

This is a Project 1 using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and thrid party APIs. Developers are often encountered with retrieving data from Third party application's API and using it in the their own website. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Our challenge is to build a dynamic intrative website that would allow users to pull Basketball player and Soccer players data.
